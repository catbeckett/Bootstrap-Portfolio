## Bootstrap-Portfolio
This challenge involved developing a portfolio site which includes the following features:

# A navigation bar

* A navigation menu at the top. Feel free to use the navbar code provided in Bootstrap's documentation, or create your own navbar by applying the correct Bootstrap classes to your HTML.
* Includes links that are applicable to my portfolio.
* Links that navigate to the appropriate sections

# A hero section

* A jumbotron featuring your picture, your name, and any other information you'd like to include.
* A work section

# A section displaying my work in grid.

# A skills section

# An about/contact section

# An About Me section in the same row.

# A footer section

* All hyperlinks should have a hover effect.

* All buttons should display a box shadow upon hover.

This Bootstrap solution should minimize use of media queries.
